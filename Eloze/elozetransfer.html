<p><i>… where?</i></p>
<p><i>Kara, please…</i/p>
<p><i>… I am so weak…</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Hero’s Shadow slowly began to realize himself in waves and tremors. At first he felt suspended in nothingness, completely without direction or idea of where he was, or if he was even still alive. He might  very well be consigned to the void. Yet he felt that this could not be nothingness. With every passing moment he became more aware of… something. No, he thought, he must surely be alive.</p>
<p>With that thought came a rush of sensation, most of it utterly agonizing. He still had a body, as he could feel pressure on his back and a light weight on his front. His head was resting on something soft. A glint of emerald green and brilliant gold flashed in his mind—it reminded him of Mabe Village.</p>
<p>He was in a bed then. He dared to open what he was sure were his eyes the tiniest fraction of an inch. He saw nothing but blackness. He could hear the rasping of wind on the outside walls, yet it felt stuffy. He thought that wherever he must be was probably small and sealed off somehow. The very air itself found it difficult to get in or out of this space, and he was rather warm. It was in this utterly closed environment that Dark lay, wrapped up in gentle blackness. He might as well have been laying in the noon desert for all this protection from the light did.</p>
<p>He did not dare to move for fear of further agitating his already frayed senses. Now that he was conscious again, he could not stop from eking small tears of pain out. Where they touched his face they did not soothe, but only hurt in a different way. How long had he been like this? Days? Weeks? In his daze he was unable to make any sense of things. He might have lost himself entirely, but he had been through this process enough times already; past experience faintly reassured him that he would eventually settle into place. At least it was nothing like it had been down <i>there</i>, what had happened to him, but he felt himself shudder away from that idea. It was still too much to recollect.</p>
<p>Coming back to life was never a pleasant experience, the shadow mused. It was a process that normally took years, though, and while his sense of time was gone it did not seem quite so long as that. Suddenly he was excruciatingly aware of something, a warmth in his chest. <i>Perhaps… </i>the thought lingered on the edge of his consciousness. His heart had no pulse, but it was there nonetheless. Remembering the violet medallion buried in his bosom seemed to take the edge off, and he managed to relax slightly.</p>
<p>Little by little, the pain continued to recede. Dark’s body still hurt in its core, but after some time he was able to discern between all of his limbs. The darkness <i>was</i> helping, and he ventured to open his eyes a little wider. He focused on ambient noises and the softness on his back to keep reminding himself of where he wasn’t.</p>
<p>After a while—he still knew not how long--he decided it was time to fully regain himself. Still not quite up to the task of moving, he began the laborious process of organizing his thoughts. Where was he? What had happened after his friends—</p>
<p><i>My friends.</i></p>
<p>The thought shot through his mind like a bolt of lightning, bringing with it a torrent of others: running through the damp stone labyrinth of the Sixth Cavern; Dinolfos realizing his deception; fighting Link and winning, but then a sudden sting of light; the sharp bite of that serpentine sword in his chest, and then nothingness. These thoughts felt alien to him—like he had been watching through the eyes of a different person.</p>
<p><i>No, I did all of those things myself. I was as before, freshly made in the Water Temple: nothing but hate and malice given form.</i> Memories he hadn’t realized he possessed rushed to him and threatened to overwhelm, but through it all threaded one emotion above the rest.</p>
<p>Dark was ashamed. Never before had he felt so unabashedly disappointed, especially in himself.  He would have slaughtered his friends in the same manner as any of Ganon’s monsters, without hesitation or remorse. He felt his body beginning to shake and could not find it in him to make it be still. Tears welled back up and flowed freely. The thought burned itself into his mind: <i>I would have struck down the only people who have ever cared for me.</i></p>
<p>Dark wept for some time, struggling not to make any sound or move—he barely trusted himself to breathe. He spent some time reckoning with what had happened, but he knew that he must set it aside at least for the moment. With effort he stifled himself, and he attempted once more to collect his thoughts. He still did not know how he had gotten here, everything after dying had been completely erased from his mind. He also needed to figure out where his friends were, and he needed to know they were alright. This was his foremost priority, but first he needed to gain his bearings. Summoning willpower he did not know whether he still had, he dredged up the effort needed to move once more.</p>
<p>The first test was simple enough, yet it felt impossible at the start: he began moving each digit of his hands, feeling as delicately as possible whether anything needed special attention. Upon completing this assessment—nothing broken or malformed, thankfully—he moved down to his arms, twitching them as lightly as possible to see if everything was working as it should. In this way, he methodically assured that everything was right with his physical body, right down to each individual muscle. It took quite some time, but finding the results adequate he then prepared for the next, even more formidable task of getting out of bed.</p>
<p>Very slowly, very carefully, Dark moved the thin blanket off. The feeling of cloth rubbing against his skin threatened to bring back the anguish he was fighting so hard against, but he pressed on. Slightly more confident in his regained strength, he let his feet down on the carpeted floor. His body was whole, but incredibly weak. Torment still lingered on the fringes of his awareness, but he was more or less composed now.</p>
<p>He breathed deeply and reached out into the darkness with gently probing fingers. They found purchase, and he made out the rectangular shape of something that registered in his mind as wooden. He gently felt along a flat surface, registering the curves of the grain twisting on the surface. With a small start, he realized that this was his desk. So, he was back in North Castle—and his friends should be nearby! They must have saved him, but how? What had happened after Link killed him? Without consideration for the strain of it, he flung his mind out seeking him or Zelda. He could not leave the room as he was, but if they were in the castle he would be able to speak with them, to let them know he was alright. To apologize somehow, though he knew not how he could even begin.</p>
<p>Yet, Dark could not detect them. Frustrated, his mind pushed out farther and faster.  The flickering consciousness of distracted, bored guards registered in his mind; he felt the cooks, focused and hard at work preparing another sizeable meal. The king, his mind a thundercloud of stress, sat on his throne and talked with some visitor. The castle as a whole seemed to be in order, so where were his friends? Eagerness began to give way to a subtle panic, but then his mind happened upon someone different. It wasn’t Link or Zelda, but it wasn’t a servant or a soldier either. Their thoughts seemed agitated—he could feel this person was pacing back and forth. He probed ever so slightly, and—</p>
<p>“Harper?” He heard a dry husk whisper. How raspy and broken his voice was! It couldn’t even be called a croak, his own throat was so reluctant to obey him. He receded, unsure, but then words leapt into his thoughts.</p>
<p><i>Is my mind playing tricks on me? Is that who I think it is, barging in on my poor head like this?</i> Dark dared not even think of a reply. <i>Oh, come on. No need to play coy, friend, I don’t exactly bite.</i></p>
<p>Dark did not know what to say, but he could feel the gentle push of the bard’s mind against his own. It felt much like the boy sounded: light and dry, teasing but without force. He could feel the good-natured mocking in the formless words: <i>Well, if you change your mind, do seek me out, would you? I’m going out of my mind finishing up this cursed play, I could do with a little conversation. </i>The thoughts ceased for a moment. <i>You know, people have been worrying about you; when your little troupe came out of the Temple it caused quite the commotion.</i></p>
<p>Dark perked at the mention of the others. Harper might know something, and he certainly seemed eager to share details. Dark steeled himself and opened his mind: <i>Come here.</i></p>
<br>
<br>>
<p>The young bard made his way to the West Tower, dressed in somewhat less garish clothes than normal. He was vaguely worried that he would be spotted here, but it wasn’t a reasonable concern; people tended to avoid coming this way anymore. ever since Dark Link had taken up residence there, even castle guards not specifically stationed nearby gave the area a wider berth than normal. Though they had grown used to his presence, the shadow still unnerved the castle residents; Hyrule’s memory was not so deep as to be everlasting, but it was deep enough.</p>
<p><i>That’s all well and good</i>, <i>but it would have been nice to find </i>somebody<i> so they could tell me the bloody passageway I need.</i></p>
<p>Not actually upset at the amount of time it was taking, he found his thoughts drifting, wandering like he was through quiet halls filled with flickering torchlight. To be sure, his agitation was not to be blamed on this; he was simply tired. Sleep was increasingly hard to come by with those foul dreams plaguing him every night. Nightmares filled with twisted shapes in the darkness grasping for him, wordless terror from the unimaginable gulf of blackness that threatened to swallow him. The mangled, sickening sounds of a hundred thousand voices screaming for help. Then there were the dreams that told him things, too. Promises of what was to come.</p>
<p>These discordant thoughts were vivid in his mind each night as he jerked awake in a cold sweat, and each time he resolved not to go back to bed so he wouldn’t be forced to see anymore. <i>Nayru,</i> he rubbed his temple lightly. <i>I should have stayed in Lotharia.</i></p>
<p>Even as the thought crossed his mind, he knew it wasn’t true. He missed his home as any other might, but he had come to appreciate Hyrule in the two years he had spent there, nearly three now. It was pleasant not having to worry so much about the cold, even in the deep of winter; he had smirked often at the Hylians wrapping themselves in thick coats for weather he considered practically mild. He wondered how his parents must be doing; with the distance between Hyrule and his hometown and how perilous the roads could be for most of the year, it was not often that they corresponded. Surely, though, they should have dispatched a messenger by now…</p>
<p>Yet, there were the stairs to the tower, nestled in the corner of two passageways. Without hesitation, Harper began climbing the narrow spiral steps. In truth, he did feel at least vaguely nervous about this encounter, but it was completely overshadowed by his all-encompassing curiosity. It wasn’t every day that a living legend asked for you, let alone the infamous Hero’s Shadow. No sane person could possibly agree to such an encounter, but here he was. He reminded himself that Dark had proven to be less than murderous so far. When the mood struck him he even seemed nice, and in the end that was all one could ask, now wasn’t it? And that ocarina—just thinking about it made him shiver! He would have ripped his own fingers off for the opportunity to hear Dark play it again, simple though the tunes might be.</p>
<p>Before he even realized he had arrived, there was the door to Dark’s room. A thick bundle of cloth was stuffed into the gap underneath the door, and no sounds came from within. Up here the tower felt like such a lonely place. The wind howled faintly against the thick cobbled walls, and the sounds of people faded up here. They were still audible as distant echoes, but nothing was discernible; for as close as they were, it felt like an entire world away. Harper considered the task at hand briefly once more, breathed deeply, and then reached out for the large bronze knocker. Before he could even touch it, Dark’s thoughts poked at his mind curtly: <i>Leave the door closed.</i></p>
<p>It made sense, he supposed, but talking like this was hardly ideal. He was less able to participate in the mental conversations that Hylians could sustain, as he found them tiresome. Instead, he simply sat against the door and wondered what he should say. What he even <i>could</i> say. All of his usual banter felt inappropriate somehow, his usual mischievous energy was gone. “Is everything… alright in there?” He asked lamely. <i>Good to know the years spent honing my oration have not gone to waste</i>, he thought wryly. No answer came forth, and he wondered if any guards might come up. He grimaced at that: the last thing he wanted was an interruption, dull questions about what he was doing up here.</p>
<p>After awkwardly contemplating what he was doing for a few minutes more, he cleared his throat to ask for details, but thought better of it. Who knew what Dark Link and the rest of that motley crew had been through down there? If his dreams had been any indication at all, then the reality of it would be unfathomable. He shuddered, unable or unwilling to consider further. He resolved to ask them all at a later time when they were more amenable though; perhaps it would make for a good play, he thought and grinned.</p>
<p>“I’m not quite sure about that,” a rattle that could hardly be called a voice issued from behind the door. Harper could not stop himself from jumping slightly—it didn’t sound at all like what he remembered. The shadow had been smooth and deep, almost mellifluous before. What he heard now was cracked and shaky, betraying what kind of suffering that they all must have endured down in the Underworld.</p>
<p>“Goddesses above, I thought <i>I</i> sounded bad after a rough night. Thought you’d give me a bit of a fright, would you?” He chuckled softly, trying not to sound anxious. “Don’t suppose I could get you anything, friend?”</p>
<p>“Not so much.” Dark paused for a while. Though certainly ragged, his voice still took on that polite, old world tone: “Thank you for coming. I am too weak to leave this place yet. I need your help.”</p>
<p>Harper’s nervousness almost disappeared, once again dwarfed by curiosity: “And what exactly is it I can do for you?” Indeed, what in the Dark World could Dark Link need from <i>him?</i></p>
<p>“Do you know…” Muted coughing sounded from the other room, and then the voice returned a bit stronger: “Do you know where the others are?” No need to specify who ‘the others’ were.</p>
<p>Harper thought he heard just the faintest hint of desperation in the question, carefully veiled, and chose his words cautiously: “As I understand it, the Princess and the Hero both left the castle earlier today and are probably frolicking around the city. I’m sure the Gerudo is probably with them as well.” For once there was none of his usual levity in the answer. He understood now the seriousness of Dark beckoning him here.</p>
<p>“What of Kleox?”</p>
<p>Harper was taken somewhat aback. Now <i>that</i> was an interesting inquiry. “The hulking lizard fellow? He’s being held in the dungeons of course.” He chuckled again. “Well, not quite. He <i>is</i> in the dungeons, but the Princess was remarkably firm that he be treated like a guest instead of a mere prisoner.” Harper paused for a moment, tapping his chin. “Truthfully, I don’t know what state he’s actually in. I asked a few times when you all came back, but everyone seems pretty reluctant to even mention ‘the beast.’” He didn’t bother hiding the sarcasm.</p>
<p>Dark contemplated this information. “How long ago?”</p>
<p>“Since then? All of you emerged from the temple about two weeks ago. Closer to three now, actually.”</p>
<p>Dark nodded to himself. Three weeks was short, far too short for what it usually took him to recover from dying. It could only be the medallion that tethered him like this, and again he felt its warmth in his chest. In the time it had taken Harper to arrive he had drawn more of the dark into him, gathering strength in his legs and arms. It would not persist, but for the time being he at least had managed to put on some clothes and stumble around a little bit. He was also sitting by the door, not wishing to strain his voice if he could avoid it. His body rested against the thin wood, such that the two were back to back. The rich carpet was soft underneath him, slightly overstimulating his skin and making it prickle irritably; he avoided taxing his body anymore.</p>
<p>“Er…” the muffled tenor came through. “What do you need with him, exactly? I don’t assume you’re asking to play cards or share a bottle of Calatian wine with that one.” Curious and playful but still measured, giving him space. Dark stared into the blackness, thinking.</p>
<p>“I need a little more time to gather my strength. When I can, I want to speak to Dinolfos. Is that possible?”</p>
<p>“That’s difficult to answer. I strayed down there sometime last week hoping for an audience myself, but he’s not exactly allowed to roam free. There’s a few guards watching him at all times, stopping him from leaving. I’m not sure how they’d take to you skipping downstairs for a chat.” A small pause. “I’m sure I could figure it out. You sure you wouldn’t want to speak with the rest of them first?”</p>
<p>Dark sighed. He did, above all else, but he did not know how to yet. There was too much that had happened, that he had done. He was afraid—not that he would be cast out or destroyed, though he thought he surely deserved it at this point. That deep shame gnawed at him, more painful than any physical ailment. “I cannot right now. I must speak to Kleox first.”</p>
<p>Harper closed his eyes. He rested his head back on the door, making a very soft thump. “Yes, you’ve made that clear. I don’t know what exactly I can do to secure this illicit meeting, but I’ll try my best.”</p>
<p>“Thank you...”  Brief silence. “Do not mention this to anyone else, not even them. Please.”</p>
<p>“Never fear, O Shadowy One, discretion is my greatest talent of all.” Harper reluctantly stood up, patting the dust and loose cobble from his overelaborate pantlegs. He lingered for a moment, then the corners of his mouth tipped back up. “I’m sure your companions understand better than you might realize. Rest well, my friend, I’ll be back later.” Risking awkwardness he remained for a little longer, but then he turned and strode back down the turret steps to the rest of the castle.</p>
<p>Dark weakly scrubbed away more tears and pricked his ears, listening to the noise of the bard’s steps gradually diminish. When he felt totally alone again he exhaled, not even realizing he had been holding his breath. The boy was odd in his way, but clearly meant well. He had so many questions and had not asked any of them, thankfully. Anyone else would probably have interrogated him, which he was decidedly not up to withstanding.</p>
<p>Resting against the door for Din knows how long, he finally gathered the willpower to pick himself up and clamber back into bed. Along the way his strength nearly failed him—too much, too fast!—and he had to grip the wooden desk to keep himself from falling. His hand brushed against something round and smooth, almost knocking it off onto the ground. He felt at it and his eyes opened, peering where the object must be. He picked it up and felt the ancient holes, the masterfully carved grooves. He fingered the relief of the triple triangle on its tiny neck and clasped it with all the strength he had left.</p>
<p>Dark stumbled into bed, shifting himself slightly under the covers. <i>So weak. Like a mewling kitten</i>… He had overexerted himself far too much, and he would need all of his focus soon; there was surely little time before his companions came back. He concentrated on the darkness, knitting it back into himself and weaving strength into his tired limbs. He clutched the Ocarina of Time against his chest, right next to where the shadow medallion—his heart—now resided. Memories from a thousand years ago began playing in his mind.</p>
<br>
<br>>
<p>The room was a bit too small and had been only hastily renovated to serve as private quarters. There was a hole in one corner for personal needs from which an identifiably unpleasant smell wafted. A tiny mattress was crammed into the other corner, a chest next to it for personal effects and clothes. There were no decorations, and the bare flagstones of the floor, walls, and ceiling betrayed hundreds of years of neglect. There were pieces carved and chipped from them, scratchings from previous occupants no doubt. On the whole it was a miserable place, unfit for someone to actually live in.</p>
<p>It was the best damn room Kleox ever had in his life.</p>
<p>He was sitting on the bed with his tail poking out to the side, thoroughly relaxed. He reached over and picked up a pail of cold, clean water that was sitting by the door, drinking deeply from it. He didn’t even need to beg for it to be refilled when it was empty. The compliment of guards stationed outside his room clearly did not like him, but they refilled the pail without complaint when asked. Though he kept expecting it, none of the four rotating guards ever hurled insults or threatened him; the silence of the underground hallway was refreshing.</p>
<p>He had been thrown in here shortly after Link popped out of the crypt dragging that Din-cursed shadow from the Underworld. The Princess herself had stormed down into the dungeon the day after and made it perfectly clear he was responsible for saving all of their lives, and if any one of them harmed a scale on Dinolfos’s head they would be looking for another job that very same day. He had been mildly afraid of receiving the same kind of treatment he got under Sepultura’s command, but these people were soft as lambs. They even brought him hot food, three square meals a day, and anything else he asked for within reason.</p>
<p>If this was the kind of treatment he could expect, he might never even ask to leave.</p>
<p>Kleox declined that idea in short order though. As comfortable as he was, he was growing agitated without access to the wilderness. He knew that he was becoming sluggish and could feel that his strength was diminishing with the lack of activity. A week after arriving he had asked to be let out for at least an hour to stretch his legs, which the guards uneasily agreed to after some discussion with the captain. The moment people outside the dungeon saw him, it had turned into something of a circus. They did not let him outside again after that.</p>
<p>Instead, Kleox had taken to a different idea: he would teach himself a new skill. Though he could not read the Hylian language, he had requested books be brought to him. These were short scripts, nothing more advanced than simple parables for children. He had needed the assistance of a quaking, terrified tutor from a school in town to understand at first. But, he learned fast and was able to work on his own after that, much to the relief of the tutor. Once he knew the sound each symbol corresponded to, he was able to piece together words and eventually small sentences. It was slow, grinding work; he was probably the very first of his species to even attempt learning this garbage. Yet, he found the results satisfying.</p>
<p>The guards on the other hand were probably more unnerved by this than anything else he could have done. Almost none of them had seen a Lizalfos before, and by all accounts they were supposed to be stupid, vicious creatures with no aptitude for anything that required a brain. His self-improvement was direct evidence to the contrary, and it frightened them. He had not exactly helped, of course. He teased them with gentle probes every once in a while, asking who they were and where they were from, whether they had actually killed anything, stuff of that sort. They refused to answer such questions, or indeed any other.</p>
<p>Once, for half an hour Kleox had relayed to them the story about his eye, embellishing slightly. He had been greatly amused to see one of them <i>trembling</i> by the end of the tale, chuckling to himself about that for days. At some point during a change in the guard, he had learned one of their names—a strongly-built older man named Bret—and whenever Kleox saw him, he made sure to playfully ask how he was doing. Bret had frowned at first, but each time he was asked it seemed to bother him less. There might even have been the faintest hint of a smile last time, but he still didn’t answer.</p>
<p>Now Kleox was growing bored. He was caught up on sleep for once, his wounds healed, and now he ached for something to do; he was not used to languishing like this. He was not skilled enough at reading to do so without effort, and whenever he managed to get through one of those books he found them almost sickeningly pointless. Children’s fairytales, vapid and patronizing nonsense about magical beings and heroes saving the land, as if he hadn’t experienced enough of that already. Eventually he found himself picking at his scales, searching for blemishes and scratching dirt out from in between them.</p>
<p>He was not uncomfortable by any means; he was in fact being treated better than ever before in his life. It was not freedom though. The tug from Death Mountain was all but gone for now, and what he really wanted to do was roam. He wanted to gather in a band of other Lizalfos again, stake a life out for themselves as his kind always tried to do. He had realized how petty that idea was after the Shiekah let him go, knew that he could never really go back to just doing that, but the simplicity of it was still attractive. Mountains, forests, swamps, anything would do; the world was a big place. His taste of the outside had been all too brief before he had foolishly gone back into the Underworld to save those brats.</p>
<p>Kleox shook his head. How in Hyrule had he been so <i>stupid?</i> It was a miracle he hadn’t been killed by anything down there, or by anyone up here. He still doubted any chance of being let go, had in fact fully expected execution after their already suicidal escapade. It was only due to the girls’ outcry that he had not been killed immediately when they finally climbed out of that forsaken hole. He huffed, lost in thought again about what might come of all this. Was there any chance of being let free, back into the world to live his life?</p>
<p>Eventually his mind turned to that yellow disc. The Amulet of Light. He had thought about it more than he cared to admit during his incarceration. At first he had been perfectly glad to be rid of it, taken from him when he was thrown into this prison. He wanted no more to do with their absurd quest, had already suffered plenty for it thank you very much. Yet, in a way he could feel it in the back of his mind. Its warmth had been gentle and reassuring, and he almost found himself missing its touch. Those kids had explained what they were trying to do with the whole set of amulets: it was complete madness. As soon as they opened the path to the Dark World, there was no other possible outcome. Ganon would slay them without a second thought.</p>
<p>This thought confused him, and he checked himself. Ganon? When had he ever deigned to refer to His Majesty by his actual name, even if only in thoughts? That impudence by itself would have been enough to get him slaughtered if the Dark King perceived it. Kleox’s saurian lips curled slightly, and he growled softly to himself. Being around these idiots was starting to turn him into one as well. He had come close to death countless times in the last few days alone, and he would not be involved in anymore of this if he could help it.</p>
<p>A loud crash suddenly echoed through the tunnel, interrupting his thoughts. Some of the stationed guards that had begun to slouch immediately flinched straight. The tension in the air shot through the roof in an instant. Kleox stood up from the bed and stepped over to the barred window, where he assessed each of them: their bodies were taut, prepared to spring into action. They gripped their weapons tightly; he saw that two of the guards’ hands were shaking slightly.</p>
<p>Nothing happened at first, but then they heard a faint shout: it sounded like a cry for help. The guards were visibly distressed, but Kleox found it strange. Who else would be down in the dungeons, and why? The dungeon was mostly unpopulated, so they hadn’t needed to move him very far in. He glanced each way: the stair to the ground level was on their right, and to the left the dimly lit, slightly arched stone corridor stretched on, with the far end turning a corner. <i>That noise came from far away. How big is this place?</i> He didn’t even know if this was the only way into the dungeon. Perhaps there was another stairway and some fool had wandered in. Or maybe something had opened another tunnel to the Underworld, he thought with a shiver.</p>
<p>Another crash, even louder this time, reverberated through the corridor. That tore it—the guards yelled to one another and ran down the tunnel with a rattle of their armored feet pounding against the cobbled ground. They turned the corner and kept going, their hustle audible for some time. It seemed the dungeon was actually quite extensive.</p>
<p>Kleox did not move from his spot, straining to hear whatever it was might be going on. The footfalls stopped after a while, but they did not come back. After a few minutes he began to grow anxious. Anything could be down here, and he was powerless to fight back or even run away. His breath quickened. He was gripping the bars of his window so hard his claws hurt, and he widened his eye to allow as much light into it as possible. His fear grew, and his lethargy was completely gone; he had come too far, gone through too much to die like this—a helpless animal trapped in a cage.</p>
<p>There was a creaking noise from his right, making him jump so hard he hit his head on the top of the doorframe. He rubbed his skull, growling openly and swinging his good eye around. He saw that someone was coming downstairs. They were wearing a ridiculously bright outfit lazily covered in a plain cloak. As they got closer, Kleox saw their face as it came into the torchlight. It was a young man with blond hair and gray eyes, light freckles dusting his cheeks. The expression on his face was serious, but there was a bit of mirth there too.</p>
<p>“Wait a cursed second,” Kleox muttered. “I know you.”</p>
<p>“Now that’s a strange thing to say,” the man replied. “I don’t believe I’ve ever met you before.” There was a lilt in his voice, like he was struggling not to smile or laugh.</p>
<p>Kleox snorted. “I mean I’ve seen you before, whelp. You’re that kid who tried sneaking in here a few days ago.” Or, when had that been exactly? The days had started to bleed into each other down here. He sighed: “What do you want?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want anything, necessarily. My friend wants to speak with you pretty badly though.” Without another word the man sped off down the corridor, stopping at the corner and peering around it. What did he think he was doing, playing at lookout? Kleox snorted again, rolling his good eye. It dawned on him that the boy might have caused the disturbance, which made him relax considerably. Wait, what friend was he talking about? He had been the only one—</p>
<p>—but then he looked back in front of his cell and saw two red eyes in the gloom, staring right at him.</p>
