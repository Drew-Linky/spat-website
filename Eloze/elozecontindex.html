    <p>If you're merely a visitor from the main page of my website and have no idea what any of this is, you would do well to look <a href="http://eloze.northcastle.co.uk/">here</a>. I suggest reading The Shadowmaster first, the Timeline second, and then jumping into the main story. I hope you find it as engaging as I do. For those of you who are already familiar with Eloze: welcome, it makes me sincerely happy to know you're out there. I'm sure you'll notice that I've tried to keep this website as close to the original as possible, for fidelity's sake.</p>
    <p>Eloze was my first foray into the world of Zelda fanfic. I stumbled upon it back in the lonely year of 2008, just after the last chapter of Shadow's Mastery had been released. The story and the characters within this great, spanning work of fanfiction had an indelible impact on me, and I have often described Eloze as "the only Zelda fanfic in existence that actually matters." Twelve years later, my stance on this has not changed.</p>
    <p>Dark Link's attempt to connect all of the existing mainline Zelda material into one story--at that time encompassing five games, a comic book, and an infamous TV show--was ambitious. The challenge became ever more daunting with the release of each new game, and I suspect eventually they decided that it was not worth trying to keep up. The storyline for each game became increasingly disconnected as time went by, despite Nintendo's awkward attempt to bridge all of them together in the Hyrule Historia. In my opinion, The Legend of Zelda's lore was permanently impacted by the release of Skyward Sword, which introduced the goddess Hylia and the demon Demise. Even if Dark Link had kept up with Eloze, at that point the damage would have been too great to care about tying in additional games.</p>
    <p>All of this is rather presumptive though: before disappearing from the internet in the middle of the 2010s, Dark Link mentioned that Eloze had steadily transformed, becoming less about tying all of the existing material together and more about... well, Dark Link, and his story. I always found that idea captivating. Beyond just Dark Link himself, all of the characters and descriptions in this story are a unique manifestation of Zelda lore. I won't even bother attempting to tie in the new games beyond a mere reference or two at most; it's simply always rankled me that the story was left unfinished, for reasons that are unknown to probably everyone.</p>
    <p>Whatever the cause for the author's disappearance, I've toyed with the idea of making a fan continuation for the better part of a decade now. The reasons I did not pursue this before are simple: I had no faith in my ability to write creative fiction; I felt it would be disrespectful to build on the work of another writer; and I was holding onto the hope that the original author would come back to finish their story. After more than ten years waiting for that day, I have given up that possibility with a heavy heart.</p>
    <p>I highly doubt that I will be able to faithfully capture the original tone of the story, not perfectly by any means. In preparation for this I conducted a few rereads lately and took extensive notes on characters, geography, and the progression of the overall story. I feel like I better understand Dark Link's prose for it, and perhaps even the direction they meant to go with Eloze. I can't pretend to know for certain of course, so I've decided to try and take it in the direction I see best while doing the utmost justice I can to all of the existing material. I just feel the need to provide <i>some</i> kind of closure, for my sake if no one else's.</p>
    <p>I have no idea how many people in the world know or care about this story anymore. For those who remain, and especially to the original author Dark Link, I dedicate this continuation to you.</p>
