        <p>Back in 2019 I first asked for people to contribute <a href="2019/contributions.html">some of their own writing</a>, which turned out to be one of my favorite parts of this website. After so many years, I realize that I've described many various people but they have not as yet had a chance to describe themselves freely.</p>
        <p>This page, whose title means "Voices of the People," now serves that purpose. I don't know how many people will choose to submit writing, but I have a <a href="https://forms.gle/mBjo54WcRTqFSpi49" target="_blank">submission form</a> for anyone who might feel like it. I'm not going to accept every single submission--there are stipulations listed on the form itself--but if I do, the writing will be totally of that person's own choosing, totally without commentary or input from me.</p>
        <p>If the person making a submission has appeared in this document before (that I can remember), I will also add a link to their first appearance to their entry. I hope that this will widen the look into the mindset of people who hang around in the Homestuck Discord, and in the fandom as a whole.</p>

            <p>Hsd is a great place if you want to cut your teeth in arguing, but itâ€™s a lot like 4chan in that having genuine opinions is to your detriment. You are encouraged to argue for the sake of it and choose whatever side is more expedient. I had a lot of fun when I was in hsd, but it just brings out the pedantic asshole in everyone.</p>

            <p>Imagine, if you will, an Argentine boy at the prime age of 17 on mid 2018 deciding to start reading this comic that the maker of one of his favorite games, UNDERTALE's Toby Fox, made music for, and as he reads it on his highschool classes during October while doing nothing in particular, he realises that Twitter is blowing up because a strange man with six characters for a name has hijacked the UNDERTALE Twitter account to talk about their "EXPERIMENT". Now that's one hell of a way to drag someone deep into the fandom rabbit hole.</p>
            <p>And so, age 23 at 11:39PM, this Argentine boy is now adding his contribution to SPAT, because he has nothing else to do and hopes that, if anything, this will be an interesting read. For starters, yes, Homestuck rocks, and the music especially rocks double-fold. Thanks to it, I hopped into Discord, which led me to meet my online friend group and the wider HS community as a whole, as well as other communities.</p>
            <p>One thing I have learnt of this fanbase is that Homestuck brings the best and worst of people, me included. I have learnt so much about it, like how I wish to express myself or tastes in many things or views on the world, politics and society; I have met some of my best friends through it, and learnt much more of the world that I ever could have had. I have also learned that I tend to let myself make bullshit, technicality arguments and generally act in immature and infantile ways out of a realization that none of this matters in the grand scheme of things and that due to this I tend to regress to a much more volatile and emotionally-led teenage boy that was fed by Youtube edgy atheist and proto-rationalists-turned-right-wing-or-conspiracists and learnt basically everything from them in terms of how to behave on the Internet. I'm getting better, though. Hopefully.</p>
            <p>As a diatribe, here's a handful of things I would recommend learning or getting into somewhat related to Homestuck in some form or fashion:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linux! No, really, get into it. Pick Mint, Fedora or one of the less sucky variations of Ubuntu, and learn how to use it, modify it, break it and make it your own. Yes, the terminal is a daring thing to look at, and you'll eventually be forced to use it at some point. It's worth some friction to set things up for a better service than live with zero friction on a continually worse service with Windows. </li>
                <li>Open source software! Learn to be self-dependent on programs that don't want to extract every bit of information about you and your computer. There won't be 100% equal, 1:1 replacements to everything you use, and you'll likely still have to use some proprietary software for very specific activities of yours; but the more you disconnect, the better. Besides, there's always cool and odd software you might end up finding that fit your purpose or are simply neat.</li>
                <li>DAWs! Digital Audio Workstation, aka that thing which makes music stuff. There are many free, there are many that are paid or have restrictive demos. Whichever you end up sticking with, you'll eventually get the hang of it and make your own music, for yourself, your friends or to the world. Make stuff! It's never too late to learn something new, after all.</li>
                <li>Side diatribe: Trackers! These were and still are programs made to create music using a methodology created in the 80s for old, *old* computers involve hexadecimal and (seemingly) random assortments of letters and numbers. Some of them are still being updated to this day, either for modern OSes, or for their original environments. Compared to standard DAWs they are a bitch to get your head around, but they are absolutely worthwhile learning, or if not, enjoying the thousands and thousands of hours of tracker modules already made.<br><br>

                <center><span class="imgcaption">Logos used in order: OpenMPT, Sunvox, MilkyTracker.)</span></center><br></li>
                <li>Bandcamp! If you wish to support musicians you enjoy bopping to directly, buy their music or merchandise through Bandcamp if it's an option. Especially do it during Bandcamp Fridays, where 100% of the revenue made will go directly to artists' pockets.</li>
                <li>RateYourMusic and any other review sites! Yes, review congregation websites like RYM or Letterboxd tend to be memed on by their community which is often fraught with snobs and elitists, but they are pretty much the best way to get into other musicians that isn't fed by the algorithm of Spotify or Youtube.</li>
                <li>I'll also add here that there are, indeed, software that fall into the Ill-Repute acquisition of goods. While I will not endanger the status of SPAT as a possible piracy hub, these wares do exist if you look for them and learn how to use them. But remember: snitches get stitches. :3</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Yes, this is the Open-Source Communist Manifesto, but damn it, we need to take back control! Break the machine!</p>
            <p>(If whoever reads this needs help or wants to know more, please ping me in the HSD as @cellolord, or look for the person posting news about Argentina's politics on the World-Politics thread.)</p>
            <p>If there's one thing you should take out of this whole mess is that fandoms are an omni-edged sword that can make amazing work or cut and slash through everyone and everything if given enough fuel and reasons and anger to do so, no matter how flimsy the actual evidence for any one reason or anger is. They can be used for good and create wonderful projects like the Unofficial MSPA Fans Music Team, deconrecon, Paradox Team and the dozen of fanventures and artists that have gestated and grown within and outside of Homestuck's scene, but also create situations where everything is terrible and nothing good comes out at the end, such as the Entirety of Hiveswap's existence and the Entirety of the UHC's erasure. I could also write a whole article about how much the Marathon modding community suffers due to bad actors, but that's neither here or there.</p>

            <p>To the extent that I typically appear in SPAT, it will probably be as a heel. Many think everything I say is absurd, ragebaiting, and terrible. I will first reply that I mean whatever I say not as ragebait, but as my own thoughts. I will further add a bit from my perspective to try and show where I'm coming from.</p>
            <p>I believe the world is full of suffering. Every day, untold numbers of animals suffer and die in pain. We humans are among those animals. Suffering is an inescapable part of life. There is no cure out there for it. Thinking there is a cure is its own kind of suffering. Thinking you have the power to fix the world will make you live an unfulfilling and unhappy life as the world continues to suffer and all you can do is watch it go.</p>
            <p>I think everyone deserves a chance at finding peace in their short time on this earth. Part of finding peace means letting go of your connection to that suffering. Stop thinking you have a chance to change the world. Don't be so bothered by things that happen hundreds of miles away, or long ago in the past. Sometimes, you can affect what is close to you. Beyond that, it's not in your control.</p>

        <img class="avatar" src="images/avatars/predinova.jpg" id="predinova"><p class="darkertimaeusTestified">Predinova</p>
            <p>Hi there! Iâ€™m Starfang Predinova. You may also know me as Starfang Primemeow, Nova, Star, or Prime. Iâ€™ll answer to all of those, or, if you somehow know my real name, that too I guess. I'm currently (as of October 2025) a fullmod on HSD, a position I got because WOC thought it would be funny to have "a schizo moderator who's been repeatedly condemned by other moderators" on the mod team. To be fair, heâ€™s right, it is hilarious.</p>
            <p>I first became aware of Homestuck, unsurprisingly, through Undertale. That was a big reason people got into Homestuck back in 2015, and still is in 2025. Well, I guess it's Deltarune now, whatever. I read Homestuck for the first time in the Omegapause before the release of Collide and Act 7 through a mix of the Voxus dub where it existed and the official website where it didn't, had a John shirt before I turned 11 (DM me if you want to see that, I wonâ€™t post it here), and followed the fandom off and on until the release of the Epilogues, both because they were kinda confusing and because I had better things to hyperfixate on at that point. Oh, and also COVID.</p>
            <p>COVID sucked, you donâ€™t need me to tell you about that, whether youâ€™re reading this in October 2025 or November 2424. I barely remember anything that actually happened in 2020, because it was just that different and weird. But, as COVID was wrapping up, r/Homestuck did a timed reread of Homestuck to coincide with, well, technically nothing in particular? Generally, a timed reread is something r/Homestuck and the attached Discord do every year. I guess the important part is that it always ends on April 13, which is the day Homestuck both began and ended.</p>
            <p>To give my thoughts on the reread as it was happening, I joined HSD for the first time. The reread channel, and later the on-topic channel #homestuck, were the main places I hung out for a bit. But then I discovered #mspa-lit, and the political discussion threads that were, at the time, in #media-culture, but eventually moved to the more fitting #serious-discussion. Iâ€™d say 2022 was when I was most involved in politics (Iâ€™ve dropped off a lot on that after the 2024 election because the state of US politics is just sad now), and I was willing to make sure the voices in there werenâ€™t yelling too loudly. As for lit, well, I started reading the shills, and got into the channelâ€™s culture with the help of the very document this is set to be a part of.</p>
            <p>Eventually, in 2023, I was tasked with doing an ethnographic project for a class. I decided to focus that on the HSD, with specific focus on how the Homestuck fandom relates to preservation and archival of online works. That project became <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gNCzoSvccfZcBkpwcO4Of8FGRAEcYKgkBwA6BAbpp44/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Preserving Ourselves Through the Lawn Ring</a>, which is pretty much just an academic paper, but like, a fun one. I interviewed Drew, Makin, Gio, and Bambosh for it, and still work on it occasionally as new developments come up in the fandom that affect archival (the UHC being taken down was a big one).</p>
            <p>Now for the bit where I talk about my bans. A lot of them, off and on, were because at one point, the weekly watchalong streams were of a curated list of Doctor Who episodes, decided by myself and Kaisheng21. I was very excited about this, as Doctor Who has been one of my main fandoms and hyperfixations for a very long time. However, I just couldnâ€™t keep my mouth shut, especially about the characters in Series 4, and how they related to future episodes. That got me banned for spoilers, which is fine; that was me being a dumbass, I deserved it.</p>
            <p>A weirder one is that one time, I got mad at the state of the world for one reason or another (many such cases), decided to write the names of a bunch of politicians (and the lawyers for the publishers in <em>Hachette v. Internet Archive</em> because, you know, fuck them) in my replica of the Death Note, and posted a picture of that to the politics threads. Because that was too shitposty for the threads, and could reasonably be seen as wishing harm upon those people, I was banned from the threads. Which was fair, and I accepted that as a permanent ban from the threads and lit.</p>
            <p>And it was, until it wasnâ€™t! In mid-September 2025, after almost a year of being banned, I got unbanned because Makin saw the death of Charlie Kirk as my Death Note working (even though Iâ€™d never written him in there). Plus, people kinda missed me. I fell back into my old niches quite easily, luckily. And that brings us to the most recent Reckoning, where WOC nominated me for full mod out of spite, and I got it. Did I want the title? God, no. There are absolutely users who deserve it more than me. Will I use it to the best of my ability? Absolutely.</p>
            <p>This really puts me at a weird crossroads, though. Right now, Iâ€™m in charge of policing a 42,000-person community of people all united by one thing, their love of a stupid webcomic from 15 years ago. As we move into the future, Iâ€™ll have to balance this position with my other moderation in furry fandom chats, and everything else that goes on in my life.</p>
            <p>But eh, thatâ€™s a later me problem. In the meantime, if youâ€™re looking for me, just talk about Doctor Who, Disney, politics, or furries, or hell, even just ping or DM me, and Iâ€™m bound to show up. I swear I donâ€™t bite. Not unless you want me to. :3</p>

            <p>I am Mari Middlename Lastname, my pronouns are FUCKED, and I'm here to be that friend that's too woke.</p>
            <p>I got into Homestuck as part of the "woah Toby Fox from Undered Tale was on this?" generation. I would just say "I'm a newgen" but like, I guess not anymore??? apparently anyone from Undertale being a thing to the Epilogues' release is now part of the "old fans" which uh, sucks! if you're an older fan than me, please understand, I am 4 years old, I am the youngest person ever. if you're a younger fan, die.</p>
            <p>I think Homestuck permanently ruined the way that I type, not in the gay ass "typing quirk" bullshit kind of way, but in a way where talking like a SBAHJ strip is the funniest thing to me, so sorry if I read like a total fucking lunatic. my messaging style is as scatterbrained and longwinded as I actually talk so don't worry I'm just like this.</p>
            <p>my interests are jesters, clowns, fools, harlequins, tricksters, and the color purple. spooky shit is also of my forte, especially the esoteric nonsense found online. if you like obscure and weird RPG Maker games and/or VNs, hit me up, but don't actually I'm not good at dms sorry. regardless, the shills are right, you should read When They Cry.</p>
            <p>my most notable fandom contribution is being the 1st command used in Jesterquest, and thus, appearing by name, praise me.</p>
            <p>now, here's the most important thing to know, if you want a REAL New York pizza, you go down to Joe's, it's down on Broadway, you can't miss it. it's the best pizza and you can't get it ANYWHERE else.</p>
