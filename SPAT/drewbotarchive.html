            <center><h3>Drewbot Archive</h3></center>
            <p>A far more advanced bot created by Makin, Drewbot is a genuine LLM that can make new, unique messages which are based on my speech habits. The results have been uncanny, at times. There are a few different models that Makin has made over the years now. It also has a "temperature" setting which, to put it simply, changes how creative or random the bot gets in its responses.</p>
            <p>As with Linkybot, I have a threshold for what I'm willing to put in here. Messages were filtered by whether they have 10 or more <img class="smallemote" src="pins/emotes/howhigh.png"> reactions, or perhaps a combination of other reactions, and I've combed through the resulting list to see what gets put in the archive (my choices of what make the cut are somewhat arbitrary, if you think I've missed something important feel free to <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">reach out to me</a>).</p>
            <p>A huge thank you to Kaisheng21 for assistance with finding the information and thank you also to Gio for advice on how to work with the results.</p>
