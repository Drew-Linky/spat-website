            <p>22nd of June 2019: website is created; introduction, appendices A and B are transferred over from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RWg2-us6ZJWwKbZdCe7ax63pKJCaPd88yJFdrnNskOc/edit#heading=h.1bh5j8o0jfi2" target="_blank">Google documents</a></p>
            <p>23rd of June 2019: appendices C and D completed, 2017 and January of 2018 are transferred</p>
            <p>24th of June 2019: all entries uploaded, HTML preparation complete</p>
            <p>28th of June 2019: entire website is redesigned with a new CSS style that emulates the aesthetics of Discord (the Sydlexia article emulating the Sydlexia website).</p>
            <p>9th of July 2019: <a href="2019/may2019.html#latest">the last regular batch of entries</a> spanning May 9th to July 9th is uploaded directly to the website, as well as <a href="2019/contributions.html">submissions from users on the HSD</a>. (Edit as of 5th of October 2025: this had been moved to 2020 when I first decided to "end" SPAT, but clearly that did not hold. It has been moved back to its original location.)</p>
            <p>2nd of August 2019: released the first of "minor" entries with some info from the last week or so of July.</p>
            <p>13th of August 2019: reorganized the website so that entries after the 9th of July 2019 are all located in their own page, distinguished from the main body of work. The release of such entries will still be detailed in the Changelog (edit as of 5/14/2020: see the change on 14th of May 2020 for more accurate information).</p>
            <p>14th of August 2019: released a batch of <a href="2019/august2019.html#6A">three entries</a> starting on the 6th of August</a>, talking about Perfectly Generic Podcast survey and temporary channel merger of mspa-lit with general.</p>
            <p>26th of August 2019: released <a href="2019/august2019.html#26A">one entry</a> detailing events of the second half of August, including announcement for Pesterquest and certain developments concerning Hussie.</p>
            <p>1st of October 2019: released <a href="2019/september2019.html#12S">two entries</a>: first deals with personal meetings with various members of the HSD in real life; second has information about bot attacks, a decline in the size of the fandom, and two fan projects recently released (Felt Mansion and Pro8lematic Faves).</p>
            <p>24th of October 2019: released <a href="2019/october2019.html#24O">one entry</a> detailing events concerning Toblerone bar dropoffs and the Chapel Hill Pen Box.</p>
            <p>25th of October 2019: released <a href="2019/october2019.html#25O">one entry</a> describing the announcement and release of Homestuck 2.</p>
            <p>26th of October 2019: released <a href="2019/october2019.html#26O">one entry</a> detailing the Chapel Hill Pgenpodcast live showing.</p>
            <p>3rd of November 2019: released <a href="2019/october2019.html#28O">four entries</a> detailing, in order: Homestuck Wiki edit wars, and Makin's wish failing and subsequent backup; Hiveswap Act 2 announcement trailer; Shill Seekers website by Gitaxian and Wadapan released; administrative changes to server, including new mods and rules added to welcome channel.</p>
            <p>11th of December 2019: released <a href="2019/november2019.html#18N">five small entries</a> covering a variety of topics.</p>
            <p>31st of December 2019: released <a href="2019/december2019.html#14D">three entries</a> from the latter half of December.</p><br>
            <p>3rd of January 2020: <a href="2020/2020.html#2J">first entry of the new year</a>, discussing Twitter callout posts and other drama.</p>
            <p>8th of January 2020: <a href="2020/2020.html#J8">two entries</a>, one about a new bot and another concerning internal conflict.</p>
            <p>15th of January 2020: added a guestbook to the front page of SPAT so people can leave messages for everyone else to see. The software seems to be rather janky so far, but I'm hoping it's only temporary weirdness. I replaced the <a href="backcover.png">backcover</a> with the guestbook because it was taking up space and kind of broke the aesthetics of the page, so it can be located at the bottom of the front cover (edit: this is no longer the case due to the guestbook not working at all. The back cover and the guestbook have both been omitted from the frontpage of SPAT).</p>
            <p>19th of January 2020: added <a href="2020/2020.html#19J">one entry</a> detailing escalation of the callout drama from Twitter, including involvement with Kate and Griever. Also described a few random things in the server that were nice.</p>
            <p>11th of February 2020: added <a href="2020/2020.html#F11">one entry</a> concerning escalations of fandom drama, and Makin stepping down from control of subreddit and HSD.</p>
            <p>8th of April 2020: added <a href="2020/2020.html#fool">two entries,</a> first about April Fool's Day event and then a brief description of general server proceedings.</p>
            <p>24th of April 2020: added <a href="2020/2020.html#A13">two entries</a>, one about 4/13/2020 and one about a couple smaller things within the community.</p>
            <p>30th of April 2020: added <a href="2020/2020.html#A29">one entry</a> detailing controversy around a Homestuck 2 update from the day before, as well as a couple other minor notes.</p>
            <p>14th of May 2020: added <a href="2020/2020.html#12M">two entries</a> talking about various users of the HSD. Also reorganized SPAT to reframe the timeline. Originally, SPAT was considered "formally ended" on its second anniversary, the 9th of July 2019 due to lessening motivation to write. However, further reflection after Makin stepping down in February of 2020 and a resurgence of interest in writing SPAT led me to believe it would be more prudent to restructure the website, so that the beginning of the journal up to me becoming the owner could be "Book I," and "Book II" could begin after that. This is less awkward structuring and also eliminates the weirdness of continuing to write so much after SPAT was "ended."</p>
            <p>14th of May 2020: added <a href="2020/2020.html#25M">five entries</a> covering late May and the beginning of June.</p>
            <p>16th of July 2020: added <a href="2020/2020.html#23J">four entries</a> covering random stuff, the last of which is an explanation of the drama centering around negotiations with Hussie back in February. Refer to the entry for a link to the Related Materials with a full transcript of the proceedings in question.</p>
            <p>20th of August 2020: added <a href="2020/2020.html#19A">one entry</a> describing activity of various users new and old, and <a href="relatedmaterials/appendB.html#iceberg">one addition</a> to Related Materials Appendix B written by Teratosapphic describing various memes in server's culture.</p>
            <p>30th of September 2020: added <a href="2020/2020.html#10S" target="_blank">five entries</a> discussing a variety of topics. Also added a new page to the General Contents called <a href="currentstatistics.html" target="_blank">Current Statistics</a>, containing information which was originally included in the Introduction as well as some new info. Keeping it here will serve both to keep the introduction less confusing in terms of informing the reader, and also make it easier to update the information within.</p>
            <p>13th of October 2020: added <a href="2020/2020.html#11O" target="_blank">one entry</a> detailing Makin coming back as server owner, as well as other details he provided which are immediately relevant, including reopening the Patreon, future direction of server, and a fourth Reckoning. Appropriately, updated the Current Statistics to reflect changes in staff.</p>
            <p>23rd of December 2020: added <a href="2020/2020.html#23O" target="_blank">several entries</a> covering a litany of events, including 10/25/2020, the release of Hiveswap: Act 2, and the announcement of Andrew Hussie's new project.</p><br>
            <p>4th of January 2021: added <a href="2020/2020.html#24D" target="_blank">three entries</a> transitioning from the old year to the new, including a smaller, less serious version of the user contributions for the end of 2020. Also added an <a href="relatedmaterials/appendD.html#assessment2020" target="_blank"> assessment of server activity for the year 2020</a>.</p>
            <p>19th of February 2021: added <a href="2021.html#19F" target="_blank">one entry</a> after a significant dry spell in writing, which describes the main developments in official property and provides an update on a few things that have been taking place in the HSD.</p>
            <p>5th of March 2021: added <a href="2021.html#23F" target="_blank">three entries</a>, including one for the fifth anniversary of the HSD describing a small, informal census of mspa-lit.</p>
            <p>15th of April 2021: added <a href="2021.html#13A" target="_blank">one entry</a> detailing 4/13 for the year and a couple other minor details.</p>
            <p>1st of August 2021: added <a href="2021.html#1Au" target="_blank">one entry</a> covering all noteworthy events since the last update.</p>

            <p>30th of April 2022: added an <a href="pins/pins1.html" target="_blank">entire new section</a> cataloguing the pins from #mspa-lit, by popular request. Also redesigning certain aspects of the website, including minor visual elements such as a border and tuning up the mobile version. Changed to note style entries that cover the span of time from November last year to this month, which I will no longer link to individually. If I write any full entries, I'll still link them here.</p>
            <p>19th of May 2022: updated and reorganized the pins to assist with loading by breaking them up into blocks of about 100 entries, links to the next page at the bottom of each block. Added notes for the first half of May 2022.</p>
            <p>9th of June 2022: released <a href="meetup2022/meetup2022.html" target="_blank">the entry for the meetup</a> that took place at the end of May, in Atlanta, Georgia. Also released a short entry for June 2022.</p><br>
            <p>17th of April, 2023: made general changes to the CSS spreadsheet for better usability (instead of using individual user's names, I'll be gradually replacing all text classes for usernames with hexcodes that correspond to the roles we use on the server proper). Added what little notes I've kept since last time I updated the website, including a new page for the year <a href="2023.html" target="_blank">2023</a>. Added a <a href="pins/genpins1.html" target="_blank"> pin archive for #general</a> to help out with their pin storage.</p>
            <p>2nd of June 2023: released <a href="2023.html#27A" target="_blank"> several new entries</a> covering the last month.</p>
            <p>6th of August 2023: released <a href="meetup2023/meetup2023.html">the entry for the meetup that took place in July.</a> Also, after complaints about image sizes being entirely too large, refitted the CSS stylesheet so that they don't take up so much space. This will have unforeseen consequences.</p>
            <p>9th of November 2023: released <a href="2023.html#J11" target="_blank">a handful of entries from the last so many months.</a></p><br>
            <p>2nd of September 2024: released <a href="2024.html">a few entries</a> after a long break in writing. Also wrote the <a href="meetup2024/meetup2024.html">2024 Meetup</a> article.</p><br>
            <p>15th of May 2025: in an attempt to rescue writing efforts, changing up how I do pages. Instead of entire years, I will cover isolated incidents if they're interesting or entertaining enough to me. To that end, released a short page called <a href="2025.html">"Captain."</a> (Note as of 6th of October 2025: wrote enough this year to combine Captain and later events all into one page, the entry in question is at the beginning of 2025.)</p>
            <p>13th of August 2025: several entries released in <a href="2025.html"> a single page</a> covering a litany of events, especially drama regarding the Unofficial Homestuck Collection and the news of the animated series.</p>
            <p>22nd of August 2025: added a <a href="textdump.html" target="_blank">text dump</a> to the website to make searching across all entries much easier. In combination with this, after much deliberation I changed back most censored names with a couple minor exceptions. This doesn't really affect anything after 2018, and the decision was made for increased historical accuracy.</p>
            <p>26nd of August 2025: released <a href="2025.html#12" target="_blank">a few entries</a> in the page for August 2025. Lots of stuff happening this month.</p>
            <p>9th of September 2025: released <a href="2025.html#26" target="_blank">a few entries</a> and restyled the "Weeks" page to be for the last half of the year, on the assumption I'll be writing a bit more than usual. Will also be going through to do some stylistic changes to the website eventually. Also added three materials to Appendix D.</a></p>
            <p>22nd of September 2025: released <a href="2025.html#9S" target="_blank">several entries</a> and an <a href="bowmaninterview.html" target="_blank">interview with Michael Guy Bowman</a> I conducted today. The full audio and transcript are both available.</p>
            <p>9th of October 2025: the site has been fully revamped with improved CSS including for mobile devices, as well as a sidebar navigation menu. The HTML on every page has been standardized on every page to make future changes less daunting. The date headers for every entry have also been standardized, with a couple of minor exceptions in the Text Dump. If anyone notices missing features, please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
            <p>11th of October 2025: added <a href="2025.html#23S">several entries</a>, which detail the Seventh Reckoning, the Animation Pilot stream, and some site revamp. The latter involves the release of the <a href="vocespopuli.html">Voces Populi</a> page, as well as some additions to the Related Materials such as the list of <a href="relatedmaterials/appendB.html#similarprojects">similar projects</a> to SPAT, located in Appendix B.</a></p>
