      <blockquote>The first few years are indisputably the main body of this document, containing by far the most dense writing with entries on a near daily basis for two years, and then less frequently from August 2019 up through February of 2020. This timespan also contains most of the establishing information on history of the Homestuck Discord, Subreddit, and pieces of other parts of the fandom. Of course, it also contains descriptions of most of the people involved in discussions within the HSD (though this changes as time goes on, due to shifts in the population). Entries are organized on a monthly basis from 2017 to the end of 2019.</blockquote>

          <blockquote>When I originally "ended" the main body of content in July 2019, I asked for various members of the Homestuck Discord, historied and contemporary, to provide their thoughts. This may seem dramatic or out of place considering I bothered to continue writing entries anyway, but I feel as if these contributions--totaling around 50 individual pieces--are a significant representation of the people I care so deeply about, as well as their mindset. As far as preserving our culture is concerned, this is undoubtedly one of the most important pieces of writing on this website.</blockquote>
      <li><a href="2020/2020.html">2020</a></li>
        <blockquote>Starting around April of 2020, two months after Makin stepped down and put me in control of the community (which was reversed in October of the same year), the amount of writing diminishes. To cut down on time and effort spent organizing, these are lumped by year and have no individual monthly pages. In the most sparse places, there aren't even full entries, such as at the end of 2021.</blockquote>
